# hello-world
My (India Hill's) hello world assignment
As my first edit, I will describe my desk. I have a laptop, hand-me-down monitor from my uncle, a charging pad for my phone, a mouse pad + mouse, a water bottle, and a coaster that currently has iced matcha on it.

As my first branch, I will be describing my room. Giving plant girl, lots of earth tones, and big windows. I love it.
